# ETCH-A-SKETCH GAME 

This is a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch.

The grid defaults to a 16x16 grid. The button at the top accepts a user value between 1-100 to create a new grid of that size without changing the total amount of pixels used. 

In addition, there have been a series of modifications that transform the behavior of each square when interacting with the mouse.

Each square's color is a random RGB values with each interaction. In addition, with each interaction opacity goes up. Opacity starts at 10, and with each interaction goes up by 1 to 100. Creating a new grid restarts the opacity.
